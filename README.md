## Overview

StrataVariance Labs (SVL) develops open frameworks for evaluating and verifying reasoning systems.  
Our current flagship initiative is the **Keel Framework**, which formalizes *reciprocal validation within bounds* ‚Äî a method to detect, measure, and document reasoning drift without in-line correction.

Keel operates by mirroring inference paths (forward and reciprocal passes) and comparing their logical consistency.  
The goal: build reproducible reasoning pipelines that preserve **signal integrity** across runs and models.

## Keel Framework

**Tagline:** _Reciprocal validation within bounds for reasoning systems._

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Quantify and log reasoning drift in generative or deterministic systems. |
| **Core concept** | Reciprocal reconstruction ‚Äî testing whether conclusions remain valid when reasoning direction is reversed. |
| **Scope** | Evaluation, safety, reproducibility, and QA of reasoning outputs. |
| **What it isn‚Äôt** | A truth engine or correction layer; Keel documents drift, not removes it. |
